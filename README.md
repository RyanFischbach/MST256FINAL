MST256 Final Project: Predicting Total Video Game Copies Sold Using The “Video Game Sales with Ratings” Dataset

Video games continue to grow in popularity, with children and adults playing them at increasing rates. This amount of time invested in video games in addition to the free tools to create them provide an opportunity to analyze what factors make a video game likely to sell more copies. With a flooded market, video game creators must do what they can to differentiate their game from the others while also picking different factors that will allow their game to succeed. This report has the guiding question of what are the best predictors of video game sales and what choices can a game studio make to maximize the number of copies sold?` To answer this question, a model was created using a stepwise selection algorithm in order to maximize the predictive power of the model as well as its simplicity. Once this model was created, several specific questions were asked including: what platform should be selected to maximize global copies sold, what rating should the game have to maximize global copies sold, and what genre should the game be to maximize copies sold? Using individual variable significance tests in combination with these categorical variables, it was determined that in order to maximize the predicted number of copies sold, a game studio should design a game that is on Xbox One, is rated E for everyone, and is classified as a simulation. In addition, a multiple logistic regression model was created predicting if a company would make its money back to corroborate the predictions for the best factors when creating a video game.
